## Summary
There are key findings that I have discovered through the analysis. 

* Trip duration for most users is less than 10 minutes. 
* More than half of the user are male.
* Most subscribers are male and they use citi bike during weekday.
* During weekday, there are high number of users around 8 am and between 5 pm and 6 pm.

It is clear that the most users are male and they use the service for commute. 


For the future analysis I would suggest the two analysis. 
1. Start Locations by Usertype.

2. End Locations by Usertype.
